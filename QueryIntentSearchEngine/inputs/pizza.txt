Etymology
Pizza
with
cheese
and
toppings
cut
into
slices
The
word
pizza
first
appeared
in
Latin
text
from
the
central
Italian
town
of
Gaeta
then
still
part
of
the
Byzantine
Empire
in
997
AD
the
text
states
that
tenant
of
certain
property
is
to
give
the
bishop
of
Gaeta
duodecim
pizze
twelve
pizzas
every
Christmas
Day
and
another
twelve
every

The
word

can
in
turn
be
traced
to
either
Ancient
Greek
pikte
fermented
pastry
which
in
Latin
became

The
Etymological
Dictionary
of
the
Italian
Language
explains
it
as
coming
from
dialectal

clamp
as
in
modern
Italian
pinze

pincers

The
Lombardic
word
bizzo

was
brought
to
Italy
in
the
middle
of
the

The

could
be
explained
by
the

consonant
shift
and
it
has
been
noted
in
this

popular
contemporary

holds
that
the

pizza
Margherita
was
invented
in
1889,
when
the
Royal
Palace
of
Capodimonte
commissioned

Neapolitan
pizzaiolo
pizza
maker
Raffaele
Esposito
to
create

or

Methods
have
been
developed
to
overcome
challenges
such
as
preventing
the
sauce
from
combining
with
the
dough
and
producing
crust
that
can
be
frozen
and
reheated
without
becoming
