History
The
term
cake
has
long
history
The
word
itself
is
of
Viking
origin
from
the
Old
Norse
word
kaka
The
ancient
Greeks
called
cake
plakous
which
was
derived
from
the
word
for
flat
plakoeis
It
was
baked
using
flour
mixed
with
eggs
milk
nuts
and
honey
They
also
had
cake
called
satura
which
was
flat
heavy
cake
During
the
Roman
period
the
name
for
cake
became
placenta
which
was
derived
from
the
Greek
term
placenta
was
baked
on
pastry
base
or
inside
pastry
case
The
Greeks
invented
beer
as
leavener
frying
fritters
in
olive
oil
and
cheesecakes
using
goat's
milk
In
ancient
Rome
the
basic
bread
dough
was
sometimes
enriched
with
butter
eggs
and
honey
which
produced
sweet
and
cake
like
baked
good
Latin
poet
Ovid
refers
to
his
and
his
brother's
birthday
party
and
cake
in
his
first
book
of
exile
Tristia
Early
cakes
in
England
were
also
essentially
bread
the
most
obvious
differences
between
cake
and
bread
were
the
round
flat
shape
of
the
cakes
and
the
cooking
method
which
turned
cakes
over
once
while
cooking
while
bread
was
left
upright
throughout
the
baking
process
Sponge
cakes
leavened
with
beaten
eggs
originated
during
the
Renaissance
possibly
in
Spain

Cake
mix
in
plastic
packets
During
the
Great
Depression
there
was
surplus
of
molasses
and
the
need
to
provide
easily
made
food
to
millions
of
economically
depressed
people
in
the
United
States
One
company
patented
cake
bread
mix
to
deal
with
this
economic
situation
and
thereby
established
the
first
line
of
cake
in
box
In
so
doing
cake
as
it
is
known
today
became
mass
produced
good
rather
than
home
or
bakery
made
specialty
Later
during
the
post
war
boom
other
American
companies
notably
General
Mills
developed
this
idea
further
marketing
cake
mix
on
the
principle
of
convenience
especially
to
housewives
When
sales
dropped
heavily
in
the
1950
marketers
discovered
that
baking
cakes
once
task
at
which
housewives
could
exercise
skill
and
creativity
had
become
dispiriting
This
was
period
in
American
ideological
history
when
women
retired
from
the
war
time
labor
force
were
confined
to
the
domestic
sphere
while
still
exposed
to
the
blossoming
consumerism
in
the
US
This
inspired
psychologist
Ernest
Dichter
to
find
solution
to
the
cake
mix
problem
in
the
frosting
10
Since
making
the
cake
was
so
simple
housewives
and
other
in
home
cake
makers
could
expend
their
creative
energy
