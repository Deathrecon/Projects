Cloud

was
popularized
with
Amazon.com 
releasing
its
Elastic
Compute
Cloud
product
in
2006

References
to
the
phrase
cloud
computing
appeared
as
early
as
1996,
with
the
first
known
mention
in
Compaq
internal
document
14
The
cloud
symbol
was
used
to
represent
networks
of
computing
equipment
in
the
original
ARPANET
by
as
early
as
1977,
15
and
the
CSNET
by
1981
16
both
predecessors
to
the
Internet
itself
The
word
cloud
was
used
as
metaphor
for
the
Internet
and
standardized
cloud
like
shape
was
used
to
denote
network
on
telephony
schematics
With
this
simplification
the
implication
is
that
the
specifics
of
how
the
endpoints
of
network
are
connected
are
not
relevant
to
understanding
the

The
term
cloud
was
used
to
refer
to
platforms
for
distributed
computing
as
early
as
1993,
when
Apple
spin
off
General
Magic
and
AT
20
this
terminology
was
mostly
associated
with
large
vendors
such
as
IBM
and
DEC
Full
time
sharing
solutions
were
available
by
the
early
1970
on
such
platforms
as
Multics
on
GE
hardware
Cambridge
CTSS
and
the
earliest
UNIX
ports
on
DEC
hardware
Yet
the
data
center
model
where
users
submitted
jobs
to
operators
to
run
on
IBM's
mainframes
was
overwhelmingly
predominant
In
the
1990
telecommunications
companies
who
previously
offered
primarily
dedicated
point
to
point
data
circuits
began
offering
virtual
private
network
VPN
services
with
comparable
quality
of
service
but
at
lower
cost
By
switching
traffic
as
they
saw
fit
to
balance
server
use
they
could
use
overall
network
bandwidth
more
effectively
citation
needed
They
began
to
use
the
cloud
symbol
to
denote
the
demarcation
point
between
what
the
provider
was
responsible
for
and
what
users
were
responsible
for
Cloud
computing
extended
this
boundary
to
cover
all
servers
as
well
as
the
network
infrastructure
21
As
computers
became
more
diffused
scientists
and
technologists
explored
ways
to
make
large
scale
computing
power
available
to
more
users
through
time
sharing
citation
needed
They
experimented
with
algorithms
to
optimize
the
infrastructure
platform
and
applications
to
prioritize
CPUs
and
increase
efficiency
for
end
users
22
The
use
of
the
cloud
metaphor
for
virtualized
services
dates
at
least
to
General
Magic
in
1994,
where
it
was
used
to
describe
the
universe
of
places
that
mobile
agents
in
the
Telescript
environment
could
go
As
described
by
Andy
Hertzfeld
The
beauty
of
Telescript
says
Andy
is
that
now
instead
of
just
having
device
to
program
we
now
have
the
entire
Cloud
out
there
where
single
program
can
go
and
travel
to
many
different
sources
of
information
and
create
sort
of
virtual
service
23
The
use
of
the
cloud
metaphor
is
credited
to
General
Magic
communications
employee
David
Hoffman
based
on
long
standing
use
in
networking
and
telecom
In
addition
to
use
by
General
Magic
itself
it
was
also
used
in
promoting
AT
T's
associated
PersonaLink
Services

2000
In
July
2002,
Amazon
created
subsidiary
Amazon
Web
Services
with
the
goal
to
enable
developers
to
build
innovative
and
entrepreneurial
applications
on
their
own
In
March
2006
Amazon
introduced
its
Simple
Storage
Service
followed
by
Elastic
Compute
Cloud
EC
in
August
of
the

These
products
pioneered
the
usage
of
server
virtualization
to
deliver
IaaS
at
cheaper
and
on
demand
pricing
basis
In
April
2008,
Google
released
the
beta
version
of
Google
App
Engine
26
The
App
Engine
was
PaaS
one
of
the
first
of
its
kind
which
provided
fully
maintained
infrastructure
and
deployment
platform
for
users
to
create
web
applications
using
common
languages
technologies
such
as
Python
Node
js
and
PHP
The
goal
was
to
eliminate
the
need
for
some
administrative
tasks
typical
of
an
IaaS
model
while
creating
platform
where
users
could
easily
deploy
such
applications
and
scale
them
to
demand
27
In
early
2008,
NASA's
Nebula

enhanced
in
the
RESERVOIR
European
Commission
funded
project
became
the
first
open

software
for
deploying
private
and
hybrid
clouds
and
for
the
federation
of
clouds
29
By
mid
2008,
Gartner
saw
an
opportunity
for
cloud
computing
to
shape
the
relationship
among
consumers
of
IT
services
those
who
use
IT
services
and
those
who
sell
them
30
and
observed
that
organizations
are
switching
from
company
owned
hardware
and
software
assets
to
per
use
service
based
models
so
that
the
projected
shift
to
computing
will
result
in
dramatic
growth
in
IT
products
in
some
areas
and
significant
reductions
in
other
areas
31
In
2008,
the
National
Science
Foundation
began
the
Cluster
Exploratory
program
to
fund
academic
research
using
Google
IBM
cluster
technology
to
analyze
massive
amounts
of
data
32
In
2009,
the
government
of
France
announced
Project
Androm
de
to
create
sovereign
cloud
or
national
cloud
computing

the
government
to
spend

In
July
2010,
Rackspace

The
OpenStack
project
intended
to
help
organizations
offering
cloud
computing
services
running
on
standard
hardware
The
early
code
came
from
NASA's

as
well
as
from
Rackspace's

and
along
with
other
open

such
as
CloudStack
Ganeti
and
OpenNebula
it
has
attracted
attention
by
several
key

The
goal
of
cloud

is
to
allow
users
to
take

these
technologies
without
the
need
for
deep
knowledge
about

contains
several
articles
looking
into
cost
aspects
in
more

most
of
them
concluding
that
costs
savings
depend
on
the
type
of

the
type

Maintenance
of
cloud
environment
is
easier
because
the
data
is
hosted
on
an
outside
server
maintained
by
provider
without
the
need
to
invest

IT
maintenance
of
cloud
computing
is
managed
and
updated
by
the
cloud

team
that
reduces
cloud

Multitenancy

pool
of
users

allowing
for

Productivity
may
be
increased
when
multiple
users
can
work
on
the
same
data
simultaneously
rather
than
waiting
for
it
to
be
saved
and
emailed
Time
may
be
saved
as
information
does
not
need
to
be

when

are

nor
do
users
need

Availability
improves
with
the
use
of
multiple
redundant

up
when

The

also
means
faster

Security
can
improve
due
to
centralization
of
data
increased
security
focused
resources
etc
but
concerns
can
persist
about
loss
of
control
over
certain
sensitive
data
and
the
lack
of
security
for
stored
kernels
Security
is
often
as
good
as
or
better
than
other
traditional
systems
in
part
because
service
providers
are
able
to
devote
resources
to
solving
security
issues
that
many
customers
cannot
afford
to
tackle
or
which
they
lack
the
technical
skills
to
address
73
However
the
complexity
of
security
is
greatly
increased
when
data
is
distributed
over
wider
area
or
over
greater
number
of
devices
as
well
as
in
multi
tenant
systems
shared
by
unrelated
users
In
addition
user
access
to
security
audit
logs
may
be
difficult
or
impossible
Private
cloud
installations
are
in
part
motivated
by
users'
desire
to
retain
control
over
the
infrastructure
and
avoid
losing
control
of
information

The
National

Resource
pooling
The
provider's
computing
resources
are
pooled
to
serve
multiple
consumers
using
multi
tenant
model
with
different
physical
and
virtual
resources
dynamically
assigned
and
reassigned
according
to
consumer
demand
Rapid
elasticity
Capabilities
can
be
elastically
provisioned
and
released
in
some
cases
automatically
to
scale
rapidly
outward
and
inward
commensurate
with
demand
To
the
consumer
the
capabilities
available
for
provisioning
often
appear
unlimited
and
can
be
appropriated
in
any
quantity

offer
their

according
to
different
models
of
which
the
three
standard
models
per
NIST
are
Infrastructure

IaaS
Platform

PaaS
and
Software

74
These

often
portrayed
as

Containerisation
offers
higher

IaaS
as
where
the

is
able
to
deploy

The
capability
provided
to
the
consumer
is
to
use
the
provider's
applications
running
on
cloud
infrastructure
The
applications
are
accessible
from
various
client
devices
through
either
thin
client
interface
such
as
web
browser
web

The

software
and

Cloud
providers
manage
the

platforms
that
run
the

SaaS
is
sometimes
referred
to
as

software
and
is
usually
priced
on
pay

basis
or
using

82
In
the
SaaS
model
cloud
providers
install
and
operate
application
software
in
the
cloud
and
cloud
users
access
the
software
from
cloud
clients
Cloud
users
do
not
manage
the
cloud
infrastructure
and
platform
where
the
application
runs
This
eliminates
the
need
to
install
and
run
the
application
on
the
cloud
user's
own
computers
which
simplifies
maintenance
and
support
Cloud
applications
differ
from
other
applications
in
their
scalability
which
can
be
achieved
by
cloning
tasks
onto
multiple
virtual

at
run

to
meet
changing
work
demand
83
Load
balancers
distribute
the
work
over
the

of
virtual
machines
This
process
is
transparent
to
the
cloud
user
who
sees
only
single
access
point
To
accommodate
large
number
of
cloud
users
cloud
applications
can
be
multitenant
meaning
that
any
machine
may
serve
more
than
one
cloud
user
organization
The
pricing
model
for
SaaS
applications
is
typically
monthly
or
yearly
flat
fee
per
user
84
so
prices
become
scalable
and
adjustable
if
users
are
added
or
removed
at
any
point
It
may
also
be
free
85
Proponents
claim
that
SaaS
gives
business
the
potential
to
reduce
IT
operational
costs
by
outsourcing
hardware
and
software
maintenance
and
support
to
the
cloud
provider
This
enables
the
business
to
reallocate
IT
operations
costs
away
from
hardware
software
spending
and
from
personnel
expenses
towards
meeting
other
goals

Private

managed
internally
or
by
third
party
and
hosted
either
internally
or
externally
74
Undertaking
private
cloud
project
requires
significant
engagement
to
virtualize
the
business
environment
and
requires
the
organization
to
reevaluate
decisions
about
existing
resources
It
can
improve
business
but
every
step
in
the
project
raises
security
issues
that
must
be
addressed
to
prevent
serious
vulnerabilities
Self

generally
capital
intensive
They
have
significant
physical

environmental
controls
These
assets
have
to
be
refreshed
periodically
resulting
in
additional
capital
expenditures
They
have
attracted
criticism
because
users
still
have
to

them
and
thus
do
not

Cloud
services
are
considered
public
when
they
are
delivered
over
the
public
Internet
and
they
may
be
offered
as
paid
subscription
or
free
of

100
Architecturally
there
are
few
differences
between
public
and
private
cloud
services
but
security
concerns
increase
substantially
when
services
applications
storage
and
other
resources
are
shared
by
multiple
customers
Most
public

that
allow
customers
to
securely

Gartner
defines
hybrid
cloud
service
as
cloud
computing
service
that
is
composed
of
some
combination
of
private
public
and
community
cloud
services
from
different
service
providers
105
hybrid
cloud
service
crosses
isolation
and
provider
boundaries
so
that
it
can't
be
simply
put
in
one
category
of
private
public
or
community
cloud
service
It
allows
one
to
extend
either
the
capacity
or
the
capability
of
cloud
service
by
aggregation
integration
or
customization
with
another
cloud
service
Varied
use
cases
for
hybrid
cloud
composition
exist
For
example
an
organization
may
store
sensitive
client
data
in
house
on
private
cloud
application
but
interconnect
that
application
to
business
intelligence
application
provided
on
public
cloud
as
software
service
106
This
example
of
hybrid
cloud
extends
the
capabilities
of
the
enterprise
to
deliver
specific
business
service
through
the
addition
of
externally
available
public
cloud
services
Hybrid
cloud
adoption
depends
on
number
of
factors
such
as
data
security
and
compliance
requirements
level
of
control
needed
over
data
and
the
applications
an
organization
uses
107
Another
example
of
hybrid
cloud
is
one
where
IT
organizations
use
public
cloud
computing
resources
to
meet
temporary
capacity
needs
that
can
not
be
met
by
the
private
cloud
108
This
capability
enables
hybrid
clouds
to
employ
cloud
bursting
for
scaling
across
clouds
74
Cloud
bursting
is
an
application
deployment
model
in
which
an
application
runs
in
private
cloud
or
data
center
and
bursts
to
public
cloud
when
the
demand
for
computing
capacity
increases
primary
advantage
of
cloud
bursting
and
hybrid
cloud
model
is
that
an
organization
pays
for
extra
compute
resources
only
when
they
are
needed
109
Cloud
bursting
enables
data
centers
to
create
an
in
house
IT
infrastructure
that
supports
average
workloads
and
use
cloud
resources
from
public
or
private
clouds
during
spikes
in
processing
demands

The

is
built
atop

hardware
is
called
Cross

Hybrid
Cloud
cross

hybrid

86

and
ARM
underneath
Users
can
transparently
deploy
and
scale
applications
without
knowledge
of
the
cloud's
hardware
diversity
111
This
kind
of
cloud
emerges
from
the
rise
of
ARM
based
system
on
chip
for
server
class
computing
Hybrid
cloud
infrastructure
essentially
serves
to
eliminate
limitations
inherent
to
the
multi
access
relay
characteristics
of
private
cloud
networking
The
advantages
include
enhanced
runtime
flexibility
and
adaptive
memory

unique
to
virtualized
interface

whether

Public

This
type
of
distributed

results
from
an
expansive
definition
of
cloud

because
they
are
more
akin
to

Nonetheless
it
is
considered
sub

computing
infrastructure

Many
challenges
arise
from
this
type
of

because
of
the
volatility
of
the
resources
used
to
build
it
and
the
dynamic
environment
it
operates
in
It
can
also
be
called

Cloud

issues
Cloud
computing
poses
privacy
concerns
because
the
service
provider
can
access
the
data
that
is
in
the
cloud
at
any
time
It
could
accidentally
or
deliberately
alter
or
delete
information
126
Many
cloud
providers
can
share
information
with
third
parties
if
necessary
for
purposes
of
law
and
order
without
warrant
That
is
permitted
in
their
privacy
policies
which
users
must
agree
to
before
they
start
using
cloud
services
Solutions
to
privacy
include
policy
and
legislation
as
well
as
end
users'
choices
for
how
data
is
stored
126
Users
can
encrypt
data
that
is
processed
or
stored
within
the
cloud
to
prevent
unauthorized
access
127
126
Identity
management
systems
can
also
provide
practical
solutions
to
privacy
concerns
in
cloud
computing
These
systems
distinguish
between
authorized
and
unauthorized
users
and
determine
the
amount
of
data
that
is
accessible
to
each
entity
128
The
systems
work
by
creating
and
describing
identities
recording
activities
and
getting
rid
of
unused
identities
According
to
the
Cloud
Security
Alliance
the
top
three
threats
in
the
cloud
are
Insecure
Interfaces
and

Data
Loss
Leakage
and
Hardware
Failure
which
accounted
for
29
25
and
10
of
all

respectively
Together
these
form

ways
to
penetrate
the
cloud
There
are
some
real
Achilles'
heels
in
the
cloud
infrastructure
that
are
making
big
holes
for
the
bad
guys
to
get
into
Because
data
from
hundreds
or
thousands
of
companies
can
be
stored
on
large
cloud
servers
hackers
can
theoretically
gain
control
of
huge
stores
of
information
through
single
attack
process
he
called
hyperjacking
Some
examples
of
this
include
the
Dropbox
security
breach
and
iCloud
2014
leak
129
Dropbox
had
been
breached
in
October
2014,
having
over
million
of
its
users
passwords
stolen
by
hackers
in
an
effort
to
get
monetary
value
from
it
by
Bitcoins
BTC
By
having
these
passwords
they
are
able
to
read
private
data
as
well
as
have
this
data
be
indexed
by
search
engines
making
the
information
public
129
There
is
the
problem
of
legal
ownership
of
the
data
If
user
stores
some
data
in
the
cloud
can
the
cloud
provider
profit
from
it
Many
Terms
of
Service
agreements
are
silent
on
the
question
of
ownership
130
Physical
control
of
the
computer
equipment
private
cloud
is
more
secure
than
having
the
equipment
off
site
and
under
someone
else's
control
public
cloud
This
delivers
great
incentive
to
public
cloud
computing
service
providers
to
prioritize
building
and
maintaining
strong
management
of
secure
services
131
Some
small
businesses
that
don't
have
expertise
in
IT
security
could
find
that
it's
more
secure
for
them
to
use
public
cloud
There
is
the
risk
that
end
users
do
not
understand
the
issues
involved
when
signing
on
to
cloud
service
persons
sometimes
don't
read
the
many
pages
of
the
terms
of
service
agreement
and
just
click
Accept
without

This
is
important
now
that
cloud
computing
is
becoming
popular
and
required
for
some
services
to
work
for
example
for
an
intelligent
personal
assistant
Apple's
Siri
or
Google
Now
Fundamentally
private
cloud
is
seen
as
more
secure
with
higher
levels
of
control
for
the
owner
however
public
cloud
is
seen
to
be
more
flexible
and
requires
less
time
and
money
investment
from
the
user
132
Limitations
and
disadvantages
According
to
Bruce
Schneier
The
downside
is
that
you
will
have
limited
customization
options
Cloud
computing
is
cheaper
because
of
economics
of
scale
and
like
any
outsourced
task
you
tend
to
get
what
you
want
restaurant
with
limited
menu
is
cheaper
than
personal
chef
who
can
cook
anything
you
want
Fewer
options
at
much
cheaper
price
it's
feature
not
bug
He
also
suggests
that
the
cloud
provider
might
not
meet
your
legal
needs
and
that
businesses
need
to
weigh
the
benefits
of
cloud
computing
against
the
risks
133
In
cloud
computing
the
control
of
the
back
end
infrastructure
is
limited
to
the
cloud
vendor
only
Cloud
providers
often
decide
on
the
management
policies
which
moderates
what
the
cloud
users
are
able
to
do
with
their
deployment
134
Cloud
users
are
also
limited
to
the
control
and
management
of
their
applications
data
and
services
135
This
includes
data
caps
which
are
placed
on
cloud
users
by
the
cloud
vendor
allocating
certain
amount
of
bandwidth
for
each
customer
and
are
often
shared
among
other
cloud
users
135
Privacy
and
confidentiality
are
big
concerns
in
some
activities
For
instance
sworn
translators
working
under
the
stipulations
of
an
NDA
might
face
problems
regarding
sensitive
data
that
are
not
encrypted
136
Due
to
the
use
of
the
internet
confidential
information
such
as
employee
data
and
user
data
can
be
easily
available
to
third
party
organisations
and
people
in
Cloud
Computing
137
Cloud
computing
is
beneficial
to
many
enterprises
it
lowers
costs
and
allows
them
to
focus
on
competence
instead
of
on
matters
of
IT
and
infrastructure
Nevertheless
cloud
computing
has
proven
to
have
some
limitations
and
disadvantages
especially
for
smaller
business
operations
particularly
regarding
security
and
downtime
Technical
outages
are
inevitable
and
occur
sometimes
when
cloud
service
providers
CSPs
become
overwhelmed
in
the
process
of
serving
their
clients
This
may
result
in
temporary
business
suspension
Since
this
technology's
systems
rely
on
the
Internet
an
individual
cannot
access
their
applications
server
or
data
from
the
cloud
during
an
outage
138
Emerging
trends
Cloud
computing
is
still
subject
of
research
139
driving
factor
in
the
evolution
of
cloud
computing
has
been
chief
technology
officers
seeking
to
minimize
risk
of
internal
outages
and
mitigate
the
complexity
of
housing
network
and
computing
hardware
in
house
140
They
are
also
looking
to
share
information
to
workers
located
in
diverse
areas
in
near
and
real
time
to
enable
teams
to
work
seamlessly
no
matter
where
they
are
located
Major
cloud
technology
companies
invest
billions
of
dollars
per
year
in
cloud
Research
and
Development
For
example
in
2011
Microsoft
committed
90
percent
of
its
9.6
billion
budget
to
its
cloud
141
Research
by
investment
bank
Centaur
Partners
in
late
2015
forecasted
that
SaaS
revenue
would
grow
from
13.5
billion
in
2011
to
32.8
billion
in
2016
142
Since
the
global
pandemic
of
2020,
it
is
said
that
cloud
technology
jumped
ahead
in
popularity
due
to
the
level
of
security
of
data
and
the
flexibility
of
working
options
for
all
employees
notably
remote
workers
For
example
Zoom
grew
over
160
in
2020
alone
143
In
2021,
software
as
service
SaaS
still
will
be
the
largest
market
segment
for
end
user

IT

it
expected
to
grow
approximately
16
percent
to
117.8

PaaS
is
expected
to
grow
at

according
to
Gartner

Digital
forensics
in
the
cloud
The
issue
of
carrying
out
investigations
where
the
cloud
storage
devices
cannot
be
physically
accessed
has
generated
number
of
changes
to
the
way
that
digital
evidence
is
located
and
collected
145
New
process
models
have
been
developed
to
formalize
collection
146
In
some
scenarios
existing
digital
forensics
tools
can
be
employed
to
access
cloud
storage
as
networked
drives
although
this
is
slow
process
generating
large
amount
of
internet
traffic
citation
needed
An
alternative
approach
is
to
deploy
tool
that
processes
in
the
cloud
itself
147
For
organizations
using
Office
365
with
an
subscription
there
is
the
option
to
use
Microsoft's
built
in
discovery
resources
although
these
do
not
provide
all
the
functionality
that
is
typically
required
for
forensic
process
