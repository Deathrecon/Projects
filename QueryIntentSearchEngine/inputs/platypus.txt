1799
The
platypus
Ornithorhynchus
anatinus
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
duck
billed
platypus
is
semiaquatic
egg
laying
mammal
endemic
to
eastern
Australia
including
Tasmania
The
platypus
is
the
sole
living
representative
of
its
family
Ornithorhynchidae
and
genus
Ornithorhynchus
though
number
of
related
species
appear
in
the
fossil
record
Together
with
the
four
species
of
echidna
it
is
one
of
the
five
extant
species
of
monotremes
the
only
mammals
that
lay
eggs
instead
of
giving
birth
to
live
young
they
are
all
native
to
Australasia
Like
other
monotremes
it
senses
prey
through
electrolocation
It
is
one
of
the
few
species
of
venomous
mammals
as
the
male
platypus
has
spur
on
the
hind
foot
that
delivers
venom
capable
of
causing
severe
pain
to
humans
The
unusual
appearance
of
this
egg
laying
duck
billed
beaver
tailed
otter
footed
mammal
baffled
European
naturalists
when
they
first
encountered
it
and
the
first
scientists
to
examine
preserved
platypus
body
in
1799
judged
it
fake
made
of
several
animals
sewn
together
The
unique
features
of
the
platypus
make
it
an
important
subject
in
the
study
of
evolutionary
biology
and
recognisable
and
iconic
symbol
of
Australia
It
is
culturally
significant
to
several
Aboriginal
peoples
of
Australia
who
also
used
to
hunt
the
animal
for
food
It
has
appeared
as
mascot
at
national
events
and
features
on
the
reverse
of
the
Australian
twenty
cent
coin
and
the
platypus
is
the
animal
emblem
of
the
state
of
New
South
Wales
Until
the
early
20
th
century
humans
hunted
the
platypus
for
its
fur
but
it
is
now
protected
throughout
its
range
Although
captive
breeding
programs
have
had
only
limited
success
and
the
platypus
is
vulnerable
to
the
effects
of
pollution
it
is
not
under
any
immediate
threat
As
of
2020,
the
platypus
is
legally
protected
species
in
all
states
where
it
occurs
It
is
listed
as
an
endangered
species
in
South
Australia
and
Victoria
and
has
been
recommended
for
listing
in
New
South
Wales
The
species
is
classified
as
near
threatened
species
by
the
IUCN
but
November
2020
report
has
recommended
that
it
is
upgraded
to
threatened
species
under
the
federal
EPBC
Act
due
to
habitat
destruction
and
declining
numbers
in
all
states

Frederick
Nodder's
illustration
from
the
first
scientific
description
in
1799
of
Platypus
anatinus
When
the
platypus
was
first
encountered
by
Europeans
in
1798,
pelt
and
sketch
were
sent
back
to
Great
Britain
by
Captain
John
Hunter
the
second
Governor
of
New
South
Wales
British
scientists'
initial
hunch
was
that
the
attributes
were
hoax
George
Shaw
who
produced
the
first
description
of
the
animal
in
the
Naturalist's
Miscellany
in
1799,
stated
it
was
impossible
not
to
entertain
doubts
as
to
its
genuine
nature
and
Robert
Knox
believed
it
might
have
been
produced
by
some
Asian
taxidermist
It
was
thought
that
somebody
had
sewn
duck's
beak
onto
the
body
of
beaver
like
animal
Shaw
even
took
pair
of
scissors
to
the
dried
skin
to
check
for
stitches
The
common
name
platypus
literally
means
flat
foot'
deriving
from
the
Greek
word
plat
pous
from
plat
broad
wide
flat'
10
and
po
foot'
11
12
Shaw
initially
assigned
the
species
the
Linnaean
name
Platypus
anatinus
when
he
described
it
13
but
the
genus
term
was
quickly
discovered
to
already
be
in
use
as
the
name
of
the
wood
boring
ambrosia
beetle
genus
Platypus
14
It
was
independently
described
as
Ornithorhynchus
paradoxus
by
Johann
Blumenbach
in
1800
from
specimen
given
to
him
by
Sir
Joseph
Banks
15
and
following
the
rules
of
priority
of
nomenclature
it
was
later
officially
recognised
as
Ornithorhynchus
anatinus
14
The
scientific
name
Ornithorhynchus
anatinus
literally
means
duck
like
bird
snout'
deriving
its
genus
name
from
the
Greek
root
ornith
bird'
and
the
word
rh
nkhos
snout'
and
deriving
its
species
name
from
Latin
anatinus
duck
like'

There
is
no
universally
agreed
plural
form
of
platypus
in
the
English
language
Scientists
generally
use
platypuses
or
simply
platypus
Colloquially
the
term
platypi
is
also
used
for
the
plural
although
this
is
form
of
pseudo
Latin
going
by
the
word's
Greek
roots
the
plural
would
be
platypodes
Early
British
settlers
called
it
by
many
names
such
as
watermole
duckbill
and
duckmole
Occasionally
it
is
specifically
called
the
duck
billed
platypus
Description
Platypus
in
Broken
River
Queensland
In
David
Collins's
account
of
the
new
colony
1788
1801,
he
describes
coming
across
an
amphibious
animal
of
the
mole
species
His
account
includes
drawing
of
the
animal
16
The
body
and
the
broad
flat
tail
of
the
platypus
are
covered
with
dense
brown
biofluorescent
fur
that
traps
layer
of
insulating
air
to
keep
the
animal
warm
14
17
The
fur
is
waterproof
and
the
texture
is
akin
to
that
of
mole
18
The
platypus
uses
its
tail
for
storage
of
fat
reserves
an
adaptation
also
found
in
animals
such
as
the
Tasmanian
devil
19
The
webbing
on
the
feet
is
more
significant
on
the
front
feet
and
is
folded
back
when
walking
on
land
The
elongated
snout
and
lower
jaw
are
covered
in
soft
skin
forming
the
bill
The
nostrils
are
located
on
the
dorsal
surface
of
the
snout
while
the
eyes
and
ears
are
located
in
groove
set
just
back
from
it
this
groove
is
closed
when
swimming
14
Platypuses
have
been
heard
to
emit
low
growl
when
disturbed
and
range
of
other
vocalisations
have
been
reported
in

with
substantial
variation
in

size
from
one
region
to
another
This
pattern
does
not
seem
to
follow
any
particular
climatic
rule
and
may
be
due
to
other
environmental
factors
such
as
predation
and
human
encroachment
20
The
platypus
has
an
average
body
temperature
of
about
32
90
rather
than
the
37
99
typical
of
placental
mammals
21
Research
suggests
this
has
been
gradual
adaptation
to
harsh
environmental
conditions
on
the
part
of
the
small
number
of
surviving
monotreme
species
rather
than
historical
characteristic
of
monotremes
22
23
Modern
platypus
young
have
three
teeth
in
each
of
the
maxillae
one
premolar
and
two
molars
and
dentaries
three
molars
which
they
lose
before
or
just
after
leaving
the
breeding
burrow
14
adults
have
heavily
keratinised
pads
called
ceratodontes
in
their
place
which
they
use
to
grind
food
14
24
25
The
first
upper
and
third
lower
cheek
teeth
of
platypus
nestlings
are
small
each
having
one
principal
cusp
while
the
other
teeth
have
two
main
cusps
26
The
platypus
jaw
is
constructed
differently
from
that
of
other
mammals
and
the
jaw
opening
muscle
is
different
14
As
in
all
true
mammals
the
tiny
bones
that
conduct
sound
in
the
middle
ear
are
fully
incorporated
into
the
skull
rather
than
lying
in
the
jaw
as
in
pre
mammalian
synapsids
However
the
external
opening
of
the
ear
still
lies
at
the
base
of
the
jaw
14
The
platypus
has
extra
bones
in
the
shoulder
girdle
including
an
interclavicle
which
is
not
found
in
other
mammals
14
As
in
many
other
aquatic
and
semiaquatic
vertebrates
the
bones
show
osteosclerosis
increasing
their
density
to
provide
ballast
27
It
has
reptilian
gait
with
the
legs
on
the
sides
of
the
body
rather
than
underneath
14
When
on
land
it
engages
in
knuckle
walking
on
its
front
feet
to
protect
the
webbing
between
the
toes

Venom
Main
article
Platypus
venom
The
calcaneus
spur
found
on
the
male's
hind
limb
is
used
to
deliver
venom
While
both
male
and
female
platypuses
are
born
with
ankle
spurs
only
the
spurs
on
the
male's
back
ankles
deliver
venom
29
30
31
composed
largely
of
defensin
like
proteins
DLPs
three
of
which
are
unique
to
the
platypus
32
The
DLPs
are
produced
by
the
immune
system
of
the
platypus
The
function
of
defensins
is
to
cause
lysis
in
pathogenic
bacteria
and
viruses
but
in
platypuses
they
also
are
formed
into
venom
for
defence
Although
powerful
enough
to
kill
smaller
animals
such
as
dogs
the
venom
is
not
lethal
to
humans
but
the
pain
is
so
excruciating
that
the
victim
may
be
incapacitated
32
33
Oedema
rapidly
develops
around
the
wound
and
gradually
spreads
throughout
the
affected
limb
Information
obtained
from
case
histories
and
anecdotal
evidence
indicates
the
pain
develops
into
long
lasting
hyperalgesia
heightened
sensitivity
to
pain
that
persists
for
days
or
even
months
34
35
Venom
is
produced
in
the
crural
glands
of
the
male
which
are
kidney
shaped
alveolar
glands
connected
by
thin
walled
duct
to
calcaneus
spur
on
each
hind
limb
The
female
platypus
in
common
with
echidnas
has
rudimentary
spur
buds
that
do
not
develop
dropping
off
before
the
end
of
their
first
year
and
lack
functional
crural
glands
14
The
venom
appears
to
have
different
function
from
those
produced
by
non
mammalian
species
its
effects
are
not
life
threatening
to
humans
but
nevertheless
powerful
enough
to
seriously
impair
the
victim
Since
only
males
produce
venom
and
production
rises
during
the
breeding
season
it
may
be
used
as
an
offensive
weapon
to
assert
dominance
during
this
period
32
Similar
spurs
are
found
on
many
archaic
mammal
groups
indicating
that
this
is
an
ancient
characteristic
for
mammals
as
whole
and
not
exclusive
to
the
platypus
or
other
monotremes
36
Electrolocation
Platypus
shown
to
children
Monotremes
are
the
only
mammals
apart
from
at
least
one
species
of
dolphin
37
known
to
have
sense
of
electroreception
they
locate
their
prey
in
part
by
detecting
electric
fields
generated
by
muscular
contractions
The
platypus's
electroreception
is
the
most
sensitive
of
any
monotreme
38
39
The
electroreceptors
are
located
in
rostrocaudal
rows
in
the
skin
of
the
bill
while
mechanoreceptors
which
detect
touch
are
uniformly
distributed
across
the
bill
The
electrosensory
area
of
the
cerebral
cortex
is
contained
within
the
tactile
somatosensory
area
and
some
cortical
cells
receive
input
from
both
electroreceptors
and
mechanoreceptors
suggesting
close
association
between
the
tactile
and
electric
senses
Both
electroreceptors
and
mechanoreceptors
in
the
bill
dominate
the
somatotopic
map
of
the
platypus
brain
in
the
same
way
human
hands
dominate
the
Penfield
homunculus
map
40
41
The
platypus
can
determine
the
direction
of
an
electric
source
perhaps
by
comparing
differences
in
signal
strength
across
the
sheet
of
electroreceptors
This
would
explain
the
characteristic
side
to
side
motion
of
the
animal's
head
while
hunting
The
cortical
convergence
of
electrosensory
and
tactile
inputs
suggests
mechanism
that
determines
the
distance
of
prey
that
when
they
move
emit
both
electrical
signals
and
mechanical
pressure
pulses
The
platypus
uses
the
difference
between
arrival
times
of
the
two
signals
to
sense
distance

the
platypus
closes
its
eyes
ears
and
nose
each
time
it
dives
43
Rather
when
it
digs
in
the
bottom
of
streams
with
its
bill
its
electroreceptors
detect
tiny
electric
currents
generated
by
muscular
contractions
of
its
prey
so
enabling
it
to
distinguish
between
animate
and
inanimate
objects
which
continuously
stimulate
its
mechanoreceptors
39
Experiments
have
shown
the
platypus
will
even
react
to
an
artificial
shrimp
if
small
electric
current
is
passed
through

Monotreme
electrolocation
probably
evolved
in
order
to
allow
the
animals
to
forage
in
murky
waters
and
may
be
tied
to
their
tooth

45
The
extinct
Obdurodon
was
electroreceptive
but
unlike
the
modern
platypus
it
foraged
pelagically
near
the
ocean
surface
45
Eyes
In
recent
studies
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
eyes
of
the
platypus
are
more
similar
to
those
of
Pacific
hagfish
or
Northern
Hemisphere
lampreys
than
to
those
of
most
tetrapods
The
eyes
also
contain
double
cones
which
most
mammals
do
not
have
46
Although
the
platypus's
eyes
are
small
and
not
used
under
water
several
features
indicate
that
vision
played
an
important
role
in
its
ancestors
The
corneal
surface
and
the
adjacent
surface
of
the
lens
is
flat
while
the
posterior
surface
of
the
lens
is
steeply
curved
similar
to
the
eyes
of
other
aquatic
mammals
such
as
otters
and
sea
lions
temporal
ear
side
concentration
of
retinal
ganglion
cells
important
for
binocular
vision
indicates
role
in
predation
while
the
accompanying
visual
acuity
is
insufficient
for
such
activities
Furthermore
this
limited
acuity
is
matched
by
low
cortical
magnification
small
lateral
geniculate
nucleus
and
large
optic
tectum
suggesting
that
the
visual
midbrain
plays
more
important
role
than
the
visual
cortex
as
in
some
rodents
These
features
suggest
that
the
platypus
has
adapted
to
an
aquatic
and
nocturnal
lifestyle
developing
its
electrosensory
system
at
the
cost
of
its
visual
system
an
evolutionary
process
paralleled
by
the
small
number
of
electroreceptors
in
the
short
beaked
echidna
which
dwells
in
dry
environments
whilst
the
long
beaked
echidna
which
lives
in
moist
environments
is
intermediate
between
the
other
two
monotremes
40
Biofluorescence
In
2020,
research
in
biofluorescence
revealed
the
platypus

of
the

The
platypus
is
no
longer
found
in
the
main
part
of
the
Murray
Darling
Basin
possibly
due
to
the
declining
water
quality
brought
about
by
extensive
land
clearing
and

schemes
55
Along

its
distribution
is
unpredictable
it
appears
to
be

yet
maintains

The
platypus
is
generally
regarded
as
nocturnal
and
crepuscular
but
individuals
are
also
active
during
the
day
particularly
when
the
sky
is
overcast
58
59
Its
habitat
bridges
rivers
and
the
riparian
zone
for
both
food
supply
of
prey
species
and
banks
where
it
can
dig
resting
and
nesting
burrows
59
It
may
have
range
of
up
to
km
4.3
mi
with
male's
home
range
overlapping
those
of
three
or
four
females
60
The
platypus
is
an
excellent
swimmer
and
spends
much
of
its
time
in
the
water
foraging
for
food
It
has
very
characteristic
swimming
style
and
no
external
ears
61
Uniquely
among
mammals
it
propels
itself
when
swimming
by
an
alternate
rowing
motion
of
the
front
feet
although
all
four
feet
of
the
platypus
are
webbed
the
hind
feet
which
are
held
against
the
body
do
not
assist
in
propulsion
but
are
used
for
steering
in
combination
with
the
tail
62
The
species
is
endothermic
maintaining
its
body
temperature
at
about
32
90
lower
than
most
mammals
even
while
foraging
for
hours
in
water
below
41
14
Dives
normally
last
around
30
seconds
but
can
last
longer
although
few
exceed
the
estimated
aerobic
limit
of
40
seconds
Recovery
at
the
surface
between
dives
commonly
takes
from
10
to
20
seconds
63
64
When
not
in
the
water
the
platypus
retires
to
short
straight
resting
burrow
of
oval
cross
section
nearly
always
in
the
riverbank
not
far
above
water
level
and
often
hidden
under
protective
tangle
of
roots
61
The
average
sleep
time
of
platypus
is
said
to
be
as
long
as
14
hours
per
day
possibly
because
it
eats
crustaceans
which
provide
high
level
of
calories
65
Diet
The
platypus
is
carnivore
it
feeds
on
annelid
worms
insect
larvae
freshwater
shrimp
and
freshwater
yabby
crayfish
that
it
digs
out
of
the
riverbed
with
its
snout
or
catches
while
swimming
It
uses
cheek
pouches
to
carry
prey
to
the
surface
where
it
is
eaten
61
The
platypus
needs
to
eat
about
20
of
its
own
weight
each
day
which
requires
it
to
spend
an
average
of
12
hours
daily
looking
for
food

Reproduction
Platypus's
nest
with

replica
When
the
platypus
was
first
encountered
by
European
naturalists
they
were
divided
over
whether
the
female
lays
eggs
This
was
finally
confirmed
by
William
Hay
Caldwell's
team
in
1884
14
32
The
species
exhibits
single
breeding
season
mating
occurs
between
June
and
October
with
some
local
variation
taking
place
between
different
populations
across
its
range
57
Historical
observation
mark
and
recapture
studies
and
preliminary
investigations
of
population
genetics
indicate
the
possibility
of
both
resident
and
transient
members
of
populations
and
suggest
polygynous
mating
system
66
Females
are
thought
likely
to
become
sexually
mature
in
their
second
year
with
breeding
confirmed
still
to
take
place
in
animals
over
nine
years
old
66
Outside
the
mating
season
the
platypus
lives
in
simple
ground
burrow
the
entrance
of
which
is
about
30
cm
12
in
above
the
water
level
After
mating
the
female
constructs
deeper
more
elaborate
burrow
up
to
20
65
ft
long
and
blocked
at
intervals
with
plugs
which
may
act
as
safeguard
against
rising
waters
or
predators
or
as
method
of
regulating
humidity
and
temperature
67
The
male
takes
no
part
in
caring
for
its
young
and
retreats
to
his
year
long
burrow
The
female
softens
the
ground
in
the
burrow
with
dead
folded
wet
leaves
and
she
fills
the
nest
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
with
fallen
leaves
and
reeds
for
bedding
material
This
material
is
dragged
to
the
nest
by
tucking
it
underneath
her
curled
tail
The
female
platypus
has
pair
of
ovaries
but
only
the
left
one
is
functional
58
The
platypus's
genes
are
possible
evolutionary
link
between
the
mammalian
XY
and
bird
reptile
ZW
sex
determination
systems
because
one
of
the
platypus's
five
chromosomes
contains
the
DMRT
gene
which
birds
possess
on
their
chromosome
68
It
lays
one
to
three
usually
two
small
leathery
eggs
similar
to
those
of
reptiles
about
11
mm
16
in
in
diameter
and
slightly
rounder
than
bird
eggs
69
The
eggs
develop
in
utero
for
about
28
days
with
only
about
10
days
of
external
incubation
in
contrast
to
chicken
egg
which
spends
about
one
day
in
tract
and
21
days
externally
58
After
laying
her
eggs
the
female
curls
around
them
The
incubation
period
is
divided
into
three
phases
70
In
the
first
phase
the
embryo
has
no
functional
organs
and
relies
on
the
yolk
sac
for
sustenance
The
yolk
is
absorbed
by
the
developing
young
71
During
the
second
phase
the
digits
develop
and
in
the
last
phase
the
egg
tooth
appears
70
Most
mammal
zygotes
go
through
holoblastic
cleavage
meaning
that
following
fertilisation
the
ovum
is
split
due
to
cell
divisions
into
multiple
divisible
daughter
cells
This
is
in
comparison
to
the
more
ancestral
process
of
meroblastic
cleavage
present
in
monotremes
like
the
platypus
and
in
non
mammals
like
reptiles
and
birds
In
meroblastic
cleavage
the
ovum
does
not
split
completely
This
causes
the
cells
at
the
edge
of
the
yolk
to
be
cytoplasmically
continuous
with
the
egg's
cytoplasm
This
allows
the
yolk
which
contains
the
embryo
to
exchange
waste
and
nutrients
with
the
cytoplasm
72
There
is
no
official
term
for
platypus
young
but
the
term
platypup
sees
unofficial
use
73
Newly
hatched
platypuses
are
vulnerable
blind
and
hairless
and
are
fed
by
the
mother's
milk
Although
possessing
mammary
glands
the
platypus
lacks
teats
Instead
milk
is
released
through
pores
in
the
skin
The
milk
pools
in
grooves
on
her
abdomen
allowing
the
young
to
lap
it
up
57
After
they
hatch
the
offspring
are
suckled
for
three
to
four
months
During
incubation
and
weaning
the
mother
initially
leaves
the
burrow
only
for
short
periods
to
forage
When
doing
so
she
creates
number
of
thin
soil
plugs
along
the
length
of
the
burrow
possibly
to
protect
the
young
from
predators
pushing
past
these
on
her
return
forces
water
from
her
fur
and
allows
the
burrow
to
remain
dry
74
After
about
five
weeks
the
mother
begins
to
spend
more
time
away
from
her
young
and
at
around
four
months
the
young
emerge
from
the
burrow

The

and
other
monotremes
were
very
poorly
understood
and
some
of
the
19
th

myths
that
grew
up
around
them
for

that
the

76
In
1947,
William
King
Gregory
theorised
that
placental
mammals
and
marsupials
may
have
diverged
earlier
and
subsequent
branching
divided
the
monotremes

marsupials
but
later
research
and
fossil
discoveries
have
suggested
this
is
incorrect
76
77
In
fact
modern
monotremes
are
the
survivors
of
an
early
branching
of
the

tree
and

Reconstruction
of
ancient
platypus
relative
Steropodon
The
oldest
discovered
fossil
of
the
modern
platypus
dates
back
to
about
100,000
years
ago
during
the
Quaternary
period
The
extinct
monotremes
Teinolophos
and
Steropodon
were
once
thought
to
be
closely
related
to
the
modern
platypus
77
but
are
now
considered
more
basal
taxa
80
The
fossilised
Steropodon
was
discovered
in
New
South
Wales
and
is
composed
of
an
opalised
lower
jawbone
with
three
molar
teeth
whereas
the
adult
contemporary
platypus
is
toothless
The
molar
teeth
were
initially
thought
to
be
tribosphenic
which
would
have
supported
variation
of
Gregory's
theory
but
later
research
has
suggested
while
they
have
three
cusps
they
evolved
under
separate
process
81
The
fossil
is
thought
to
be
about
110
million
years
old
making
it
the
oldest
mammal
fossil
found
in
Australia
Unlike
the
modern
platypus
and
echidnas
Teinolophos
lacked
beak

Monotrematum
sudamericanum
another
fossil
relative
of
the
platypus
has
been
found
in
Argentina
indicating
monotremes
were
present
in
the
supercontinent
of
Gondwana
when
the
continents
of
South
America
and
Australia
were
joined
via
Antarctica
until
about
167
million
years
ago

fossilised
tooth
of
giant
platypus
species
Obdurodon
tharalkooschild
was
dated
15
million
years
ago
Judging
by
the
tooth
the
animal
measured
1.3
metres
long
making
it
the
largest
platypus
on
record

Platypus
skeleton
Because
of
the
early
divergence
from
the
therian
mammals
and
the
low
numbers
of
extant
monotreme
species
the
platypus
is
frequent
subject
of
research
in
evolutionary
biology
In
2004,
researchers
at
the
Australian
National
University
discovered
the
platypus
has
ten
sex
chromosomes
compared
with
two
XY
in
most
other
mammals
These
ten
chromosomes
form
five
unique
pairs
of
XY
in
males
and
XX
in
females
males
are
84
One
of
the
chromosomes
of
the
platypus
has
great
homology
to
the
bird
chromosome
85
The
platypus
genome
also
has
both
reptilian
and
mammalian
genes
associated
with
egg
fertilisation
42
86
Though
the
platypus
lacks
the
mammalian
sex
determining
gene
SRY
study
found
that
the
mechanism
of
sex
determination
is
the
AMH
gene
on
the
oldest
chromosome
87
88
draft
version
of
the
platypus
genome
sequence
was
published
in
Nature
on
May
2008,
revealing
both
reptilian
and
mammalian
elements
as
well
as
two
genes
found
previously
only
in
birds
amphibians
and
fish
More
than
80
of
the
platypus's
genes
are
common
to
the
other
mammals
whose
genomes
have
been
sequenced
42
An
updated
genome
the
most
complete
on
record
was
published
in
2021,
together
with
the
genome
of
the
short
beaked
echidna

Status
and
threats
Except
for
its
loss
from
the
state
of
South
Australia
the
platypus
occupies
the
same
general
distribution
as
it
did
prior
to
European
settlement
of
Australia
However
local
changes
and
fragmentation
of
distribution
due
to
human
modification
of
its
habitat
are
documented
Its
historical
abundance
is
unknown
and
its
current
abundance
difficult
to
gauge
but
it
is
assumed
to
have
declined
in
numbers
although
as
of
1998
was
still
being
considered
as
common
over
most
of
its
current
range
59
The
species
was
extensively
hunted
for
its
fur
until
the
early
years
of
the
20
th
century
and
although
protected
throughout
Australia
since
1905,
74
until
about
1950
it
was
still
at
risk
of
drowning
in
the
nets
of
inland
fisheries
55
The
International
Union
for
Conservation
of
Nature
recategorised
its
status
as
near
threatened
in
2016
90
The
species
is
protected
by
law
but
the
only
state
in
which
it
is
listed
as
endangered
is
South
Australia
under
the
National
Parks
and
Wildlife
Act
1972
In
2020
it
has
been
recommended
to
be
listed
as
vulnerable
species
in
Victoria
under
the
state's
Flora

Habitat
destruction
The
platypus
is
not
considered
to
be
in
immediate
danger
of
extinction
because
conservation
measures
have
been
successful
but
it
could
be
adversely
affected
by
habitat
disruption
caused
by
dams
irrigation
pollution
netting
and
trapping
Reduction
of
watercourse
flows
and
water
levels
through
excessive
droughts
and
extraction
of
water
for
industrial
agricultural
and
domestic
supplies
are
also
considered
threat
The
IUCN
lists
the
platypus
on
its
Red
List
as
Near
Threatened
as
assessed
in
2016,
when
it
was
estimated
that
numbers
had
reduced
by
about
30
percent
on
average
since
European
settlement
The
animal
is
listed
as
endangered
in
South
Australia
but
it
is
not
covered
at
all
under
the
federal
EPBC
Act
92
93
Researchers
have
worried
for
years
that
declines
have
been
greater
than
assumed
92
In
January
2020,
researchers
from
the
University
of
New
South
Wales
presented
evidence
that
the
platypus
is
at
risk
of
extinction
due
to
combination
of
extraction
of
water
resources
land
clearing
climate
change
and
severe
drought
94
95
The
study
predicted
that
considering
current
threats
the
animals'
abundance
would
decline
by
47
66
and
metapopulation
occupancy
by
22
32
over
50
years
causing
extinction
of
local
populations
across
about
40
of
the
range
Under
projections
of
climate
change
projections
to
2070,
reduced
habitat
due
to
drought
would
lead
to
51
73
reduced
abundance
and
36
56
reduced
metapopulation
occupancy
within
50
years
respectively
These
predictions
suggested
that
the
species
would
fall
under
the
Vulnerable
classification
The
authors
stressed
the
need
for
national
conservation
efforts
which
might
include
conducting
more
surveys
tracking
trends
reduction
of
threats
and
improvement
of
river
management
to
ensure
healthy
platypus
habitat

that
the
estimates
of

Disease
Platypuses
generally
suffer
from
few
diseases
in
the
wild
however
as
of
2008
there
was
concern
in
Tasmania
about
the
potential
impacts
of
disease
caused
by
the
fungus
Mucor
amphibiorum
The
disease
termed
mucormycosis
affects
only
Tasmanian
platypuses
and
had
not
been
observed
in
platypuses
in
mainland
Australia
Affected
platypuses
can
develop
skin
lesions
or
ulcers
on
various
parts
of
their
bodies
including
their
backs
tails
and
legs
Mucormycosis
can
kill
platypuses
death
arising
from
secondary
infection
and
by
affecting
the
animals'
ability
to
maintain
body
temperature
and
forage
efficiently
The
Biodiversity
Conservation
Branch
at
the
Department
of
Primary
Industries
and
Water
collaborated
with
NRM
north
and
University
of
Tasmania
researchers
to
determine
the
impacts
of
the
disease
on
Tasmanian
platypuses
as
well
as
the
mechanism
of
transmission
and

Platypus
in
wildlife
sanctuaries
Much
of
the
world
was
introduced
to
the
platypus
in
1939
when
National
Geographic
Magazine
published
an
article
on
the
platypus
and
the
efforts
to
study
and
raise
it
in
captivity
The
latter
is
difficult
task
and
only
few
young
have
been
successfully
raised
since
notably
at
Healesville
Sanctuary
in
Victoria
The
leading
figure
in
these
efforts
was
David
Fleay
who
established
platypusary
simulated
stream
in
tank
at
the
Healesville
Sanctuary
where
breeding
was
successful
in
1943
101
In
1972,
he
found
dead
baby
of
about
50
days
old
which
had
presumably
been
born
in
captivity
at
his
wildlife
park
at
Burleigh
Heads
on
the
Gold

its
success
in

and
again
in

Since

Aboriginal
Australians

hunt
platypuses
for
food
their
fatty
tails

and
until
1912,
when
it
was
prohibited

In
addition
European

captured

killed
platypus
or
removed
their

partly
in
