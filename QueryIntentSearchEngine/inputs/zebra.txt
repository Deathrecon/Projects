stripes
come
in
different
patterns

Several
theories
have
been
proposed
for
the
function
of
these
stripes
with
most
evidence
supporting
them
as
form
of
protection
from
biting
flies
Zebras
inhabit
eastern
and
southern
Africa
and
can
be
found
in
variety
of
habitats
such
as
savannahs
grasslands
woodlands
shrublands
and
mountainous
areas
Zebras
are
primarily
grazers
and
can
subsist
on
lower
quality
vegetation
They
are
preyed
on
mainly
by
lions
and
typically
flee
when
threatened

also
bite
and
kick

Etymology
The
English
name
zebra
dates
back
to
1600,
deriving
from
Italian
Spanish
or
Portuguese
Its
origins
may
lie
in
the
Latin
equiferus
meaning
wild
horse
from
equus
horse
and
ferus
wild
untamed
Equiferus
appears
to
have
entered
into
Portuguese
as
ezebro
or
zebro
which
was
originally
name
for
mysterious
possibly
feral
equine
in
the
wilds
of
the
Iberian
Peninsula
during
the
Middle
Ages
In
ancient
times
the
zebra
was
called
hippotigris
horse
tiger
by
the
Greeks
and
Romans
The
word
zebra
was
traditionally
pronounced
with
long
initial
vowel
but
over
the
course
of
the
20
th
century
the
pronunciation
with
the
short
initial
vowel
became
the
norm
in
the
UK
and
the
Commonwealth
The
pronunciation
with
long
initial
vowel
remains
standard
in
US

Evolution
of
the
horse
Zebras
are
classified
in
the
genus
Equus
known
as
equines
along
with
horses
and
asses
These
three
groups
are
the
only
living
members
of
the
family

The

and
mountain

were
traditionally
placed
in
the
subgenus
Hippotigris
Smith

in
contrast
to
the
Gr

placed
all
three
species
in
the
subgenus
Hippotigris
12
2013
phylogenetic
study
found
that
the
plains
zebra
is
more
closely
related
to
Gr
vy's
zebras
than
mountain
zebras
13
The
extinct
quagga
was
originally
classified
as
distinct
species
14
Later
genetic
studies
have
placed
it
as
the
same
species
as
the
plains

subspecies
or
just
the

Hybridisation
has
also
been
recorded
between
the
plains
and

zebra
though
it
is
possible
that
these

the
difference
in

The
general
pattern
is
dorsal

that
extends
from
the
forehead
to
the
tail
From
there
the
stripes
stretch
downward
except
on
the
rump
where
they
develop
species
specific
patterns
and
near
the
nose
where
they
curve
toward
the
nostrils

The
stripes
on

are
separate
and
horizontal
Zebras
also
have
complex
patterns
around
the
eyes
and
the
lower
jaw
42
Striping
patterns
are
unique
to
an
individual
and
heritable
45
During
embryonic
development
the
stripes
appear
at
eight
months
but
the
patterns
may
be
determined
at
three
to
five
weeks
For
each
species
there
is
point
in
embryonic
development
where
the
stripes
are
perpendicular
to
the
dorsal
and
spaced
0.4
mm
0.016
in
apart
However
this
happens
at
three
weeks
of
development

four
weeks
for
the
mountain

and
five
for

The
difference
in
timing
is
thought
to
be
responsible
for
the
differences
in
the
striping
patterns
of
the
different
species

Function
The
function
of
stripes
in
zebras
has
been
discussed
among
biologists
since
at
least
the
19
th
century
50
Popular
hypotheses
include
the
following
The
crypsis
hypothesis
was
proposed
by
Alfred
Wallace
in
1896
and
suggests
that
the
stripes
allow
the
animal
to
blend
in
with
its
environment
or
break
out
its
outline
so
predators
can
not
perceive
it
as
single
entity
51
Zebra
stripes
may
provide
particularly
good
camouflage
at
nighttime
which
is
when
lions
and
hyenas
are
actively
hunting
52
In
1871,
Charles
Darwin
remarked
that
the
zebra
is
conspicuously
striped
and
stripes
on
the
open
plains
of
South
Africa
cannot
afford
any
protection
53
Zebras
graze
in
open
habitat
and
do
not
behave
cryptically
being
noisy
fast
and
social
They
do
not
freeze
when
detecting
predator
In
addition
lions
and
hyenas
do
not
appear
to
be
able
to
discern
stripes
beyond
certain
distance
in
daylight
thus
making
the
stripes
useless
in
disrupting
the
outline
Stripes
also
do
not
appear
to
make
zebras
more
difficult
to
find
than
uniformly
coloured
animals
of
similar
size
and
predators
may
still
be
able
to
detect
them
by
scent
or
hearing
54
The
camouflaging
stripes
of
woodland
living
ungulates
like
bongos
and
bushbucks
are
much
less
vivid
and
lack
the
sharp
contrast
with
the
background
colour
55

In
addition
unlike
tiger
stripes
the
spatial
frequencies
of
zebra
stripes
do
not
line
up
with
their
environment

The
confusion
hypothesis
states
that
the
stripes
confuse
predators
be
it
by
making
it
harder
to
distinguish
individuals
in
group
as
well
as
determining
the
number
of
zebras
in
group
making
it
difficult
to
determine
an
individual's
outline
when
the
group
flees
reducing
predator's
ability
to
follow
target
during
chase
dazzling
an
assailant
so
they
have
difficulty
making
contact
or
making
it
difficult
for
predator
to
judge
the
zebra's
size
speed
and
trajectory
via
motion
dazzle
This
theory
has
been
proposed
by
several
biologists
since
at
least
the
1970
58
2014
computer
study
of
zebra
stripes
found
that
the
motion
signals
made
by
zebra
stripes
give
out
misleading
information
and
can
cause
confusion
via
the
wagon
wheel
effect
or
barber
pole
illusion
The
researchers
concluded
that
this
could
be
used
against
mammalian
predators
or
biting
flies
59
The
use
of
the
stripes
for
confusing
against
mammalian
predators
has
been
questioned
The
stripes
of
zebras
could
make
group
size
look
smaller
and
thus
more
attractive
to
predators
Zebras
also
tend
to
scatter
when
fleeing
from
attackers
and
thus
the
stripes
could
not
obscure
an
individual's
outline
Lions
in
particular
appear
to
have
no
difficulty
targeting
and
making
contact
with
zebras
when
they
get
close
and
take
them
by
ambush
60
In
addition
no
correlations
have
been
found
between
the
amount
of
stripes
and
populations
of
mammal
predators
56
The
aposematic
hypothesis
suggests
that
the
stripes
serve
as
warning
colouration
as
they
are
recognisable
up
close
Biologist
Matthews
proposed
in
1971
that
the
stripes
on
the
side
of
the
mouth
signal
to
the
animal's
bite
As
with
known
aposematic
mammals
zebras
have
high
predation
pressures
and
make
no
attempt
to
hide
61
However
they
are
frequently
preyed
on
by
lions
suggesting
that
stripes
do
not
deter
them
but
may
work
on
smaller
predators
In
addition
zebras
are
not
slow
and
sluggish
like
known
aposematic
mammals
62
The
social
function
hypothesis
states
that
stripes
serve
role
in
intraspecific
or
individual
recognition
social
bonding
mutual
grooming
facilitation
or
signal
of
fitness
Darwin
wrote
in
1871
that
female
zebra
would
not
admit
the
addresses
of
male
ass
until
he
was
painted
so
as
to
resemble
zebra
while
Wallace
stated
in
1871
that
The
stripes
therefore
may
be
of
use
by
enabling
stragglers
to
distinguish
their
fellows
at
distance
63
Regarding
species
and
individual
identification
zebras
have
limited
range
overlap
with
each
other
and
horses
can
recognise
each
other
using
visual
cues
64
In
addition
no
correlation
has
been
found
between
striping
and
social
behaviour
among
equines
56
There
is
also
no
link
found
between
fitness
and
striping

The
thermoregulatory
hypothesis
suggests
that
stripes
help
to
control
zebra's
body
temperature
In
1971,
biologist
Baldwin
noted
that
black
stripes
absorbed
heat
while
the
white
ones
reflected
it
In
1990,
zoologist
Desmond
Morris
proposed
that
the
stripes
set
up
convection
currents
to
cool
the
animal
66
study
from
2015
determined
that
environmental
temperature
is
strong
predictor
for
zebra
striping
patterns
67
Another
study
from
2019
also
concluded
that
the
stripes
played
role
in
regulating
heat
Air
currents
move
faster
over
the
heat
absorbing
black
hairs
than
the
white
ones
At
the
junction
of
the
stripes
the
air
swirls
and
cools
down
the
animal
In
addition
zebras
appear
to
be
able
to
raise
the
hair
of
the
black
stripes
while
keeping
white
hair
flat
During
the
hottest
times
of
the
day
the
raised
hair
may
help
transfer
heat
from
the
skin
to
the
hair
surface
while
during
the
cooler
early
morning
the
raised
black
hair
can
trap
air
to
prevent
heat
loss
68
Others
have
found
no
evidence
that
zebras
have
cooler
bodies
than
other
ungulates
whose
habitat
they
share
or
that
striping
correlates
with
temperature
69
56
2018
experimental
study
which
dressed
water
filled
metal
barrels
in
horse
zebra
and
cattle
hides
found
that
zebra
stripes
have
no
effect
on
thermoregulation
70
The
fly
protection
hypothesis
holds
that
the
stripes
deter
biting
flies
Horse
flies
in
particular
spread
diseases
that
are
lethal
to
equines
such
as
African
horse
sickness
equine
influenza
equine
infectious
anemia
and
trypanosomiasis
In
addition
zebra
hair
is
shorter
or
the
same
length
as
the
mouthparts
of
horse
flies
56
Caro
and
colleagues
2019
reported
this
hypothesis
as
the
emerging
consensus
among
biologists
65
It
was
found
that
flies
were
less
likely
to
land
on
black
and
white
striped
surfaces
than
uniformly
coloured
ones
in
1930
by
biologist
Harris
71
2012
study
concurred
this
and
concluded
that
the
stripes
reflect
contrasting
light
patterns
rather
than
the
uniform
patterns
these
insects
use
to
locate
food
and
water
72
2014
study
found
correlation
between
the
amount
of
striping
and
the
presence
of
horse
and
tsetse
flies
Among
wild
equines
zebras
live
in
areas
with
the
highest
fly
activity
56
Other
studies
have
found
that
zebras
are
rarely
targeted
by
these
insect
species
73
Caro
and
colleagues
studied
captive
zebras
and
horses
and
found
that
neither
could
deter
flies
from
distance
but
zebra
stripes
made
it
difficult
for
flies
to
make
landing
both
for
zebras
and
horses
dressed
in
zebra
print
coats
65
2020
study
found
that
zebra
stripes
do
not
dazzle
or
work
like
barber
pole
against
flies
since
checkered
patterns
also
repel
them
74
White
or
light
stripes
painted
on
dark
bodies
have
also
been
found
to
reduce

irritations
in
both

Dutch
governor
of
Jakarta
These
animals
would
eventually
be
given
by
the
Dutch
to
the
Tokugawa
Shogunate
of
Japan
104
When
Queen
Charlotte
received
zebra
as
wedding
gift
in
1762,
the
animal
became
source
of
fascination
for
the
people
of
Britain
Many
flocked
to
see
it
at
its
paddock
at
Buckingham
Palace
It
soon
became
the
subject
of
humour
and
satire
being
referred
to
as
The
Queen's
Ass
and
was
the
subject
of
an
oil
painting
by
George
Stubbs
in
1763
The
zebra
also
gained
reputation
for
being
ill
tempered
and
kicked
at
visitors
105
In
1882,
Ethiopia
sent
zebra
to
French
president
Jules
Gr
vy
and
the
species
it
belonged
to
was
named
in
his
honour
Walter
Rothschild
with
carriage
drawn
by

Attempts
to
domesticate
zebras
were
largely
unsuccessful
It
is
possible
that
having
evolved
under
pressure
from
the
many
large
predators
of
Africa
including
early
humans
they
became
more
aggressive
thus
making
domestication
more
difficult
106
However
zebras
have
been
trained
and
tamed
throughout
history
In
Rome
zebras
are
recorded
to
have
pulled
chariots
during
gladiator
games
starting
in
the
reign
of
Caracalla
198
to
217
AD
107
In
the
late
19
th
century
the
zoologist
Walter
Rothschild
trained
some
zebras
to
draw
carriage
in
England
which
he
drove
to
Buckingham
Palace
to
demonstrate
the
tame
character
of
zebras
to
the
public
However
he
did
not
ride
on
them
as
he
realised
that
they
were
too
small
and
aggressive
108
In
the
early
20
th
century
German
colonial
officers
in
German
East
Africa
tried
to
use
zebras
for
both
driving
and
riding
with
limited
success

The

population
was
hunted
by
early
Dutch
settlers
and
later
by
Afrikaners
to
provide
meat

for
their

The
skins
were
traded
or
used
locally
The
quagga
was
probably
vulnerable
to
extinction
due
to
its
limited
distribution
and
it
may
have
competed
with
domestic
